- normalize volume
- add multiple clips
- deploy to cloud
- update architecture diagram (we don't need to offload saving clips)
- add dynamic running of clips that are saved (not only on entry)
- remove gcloud and store in firestore (we don't need that much storage, it should be <1gb for use with friends)
